    <h1>Information about Barbados and the Project</h1>
    <p>Barbados is the small Easternmost Carribean nation that has <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">strong cultural and economic ties</b> to its <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">environemnt</b> as well as and many <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">marine ecosystems.</b> <br><br>
        <!-- An estimated <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">40%</b> of national emplyment is said to come directly from marine base <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">tourism.</b> <br><br> -->
        As negative <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">anthroprogenic impacts</b> persist in our oceans, coral reefs continue to see a <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">decline</b> in health and size.<br><br>
        This will be trouble for both our <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">environment</b> as well as for many <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">communities</b> around the world that rely on reefs for their livelihood <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">unless changed now. </b><br>

    <p>One of the best ways to protect our reefs is to <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">actively monitor them.</b> <br><br>
        By utilizing Google Earth Pro's publically available satellite imagery, <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">16 distinct reefs</b> were traced at various intervals over a <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">span of 10 years.</b> <br><br>
        This approach aimed to examine shifts in <b style="font-weight: bold; color: #74a9cf;">reef area and structure</b> over time across the Western coast of Barbados.<br><br>
        <span style="font-size: x-small;">*Area data was generated in ArcGIS Pro and manually added to a seperate js file for circle visualization, GeoJSONs were created from the KML file generated by GEP and grouped to be displayed for the example reefs.</span>
